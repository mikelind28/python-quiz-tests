# Python Quiz Testing

## Description

This project was an exercise in taking an existing application and adding tests with Cypress. The existing application guides a user through a series of 10 random questions about Python, and then tells them their score. I wrote several component tests and end-to-end tests to ensure the application runs smoothly.

## Usage

The video walkthrough above shows me testing the application in Cypress.
